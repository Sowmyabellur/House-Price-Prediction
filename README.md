# House-Price-Prediction

## Objective
To predict house prices using regression techniques based on property features.

## Dataset
Housing dataset containing size, rooms, crime rate, school rating, etc.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor (final model)

## Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Removal of non-informative features (ZipCode)
- Model comparison
- Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²
- Visualization of results

## Results
Random Forest Regressor performed better than Linear Regression by capturing non-linear relationships.

## Conclusion
This project shows the importance of model selection in regression problems and practical performance improvement.
